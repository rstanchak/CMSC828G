\title{Questions for Airoldi}
\author{Roman Stanchak}
\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the general structure of a network that could take advantage of
the method describe by Airoldi?

\item In what other contexts could this method be applicable?

\item The number of proteins ($K$) participating in a protein complex is somewhat
heuristically deterimined by running the EM algorithm multiple times with 
different values of $K$.  Some recent clustering algorithms attempt to
automatically determine $K$ based on the data, are any of these methods
applicable here?
\end{enumerate}
